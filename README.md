🚀 Hive AI-Based Auto-Investing Bot for Web3 Tokens

Idea

A self-learning AI bot that analyzes Hive Blockchain transactions and automatically invests in the most promising Web3 tokens.

Why This Sounds Hard?

AI-based predictive model for investments

Real-time blockchain analysis

Automated smart contract execution

## 🔑 Authentication (Hive Keychain Integration)
Users log in via Hive Keychain instead of manually entering private keys.

### Implemented Features:
✅ JWT authentication for session management
✅ Refresh tokens for extended sessions
✅ User dashboard upon login

## 💰 Automated Investment & Staking
The bot automatically invests HIVE tokens based on market conditions.

### Workflow:
1️⃣ User logs in via Hive Keychain
2️⃣ Bot setup for automated investments
3️⃣ Investment logic triggers based on Hive token prices
4️⃣ Transaction executed using Hive Blockchain
5️⃣ Staking & rewards tracking through Hive Engine

### Implemented Features:
✅ Scheduled investments using node-cron (every 20 minutes)
✅ Hive transactions executed programmatically
✅ Dynamic investment amounts

## 🏆 Premium Subscription System
Users stake 50 HIVE tokens to access premium features.

### Implemented Features:
✅ Subscription Tracking using Hive transactions
✅ Auto-renewal system (coming soon)
✅ Database-less approach – Uses Hive transactions for verification

## 🔗 Hive Blockchain Integration
### Implemented:
✅ Hive Engine API for token interactions
✅ DHive library for blockchain transactions
✅ Real-time tracking of user stakes

Steps:

✅ REST API Development:

@app.get("/predict")
def get_prediction():
    return {"token": "HIVE", "score": 0.92}

✅ Web3 Blockchain Connectivity:

Connect Hive Blockchain SDK to fetch token trends.

Use WebSockets for real-time transaction tracking.

✅ Smart Contract Execution API:

@app.post("/invest")
def invest_in_token(token_name: str, amount: float):
    # Call Hive Smart Contract
    return {"status": "Investment placed"}

✅ Security & Optimization:

Use Redis caching for fast API responses.

Implement rate limiting and access control.

🌐 3️⃣ Frontend (AI Dashboard)

Goal:

Create an interactive dashboard showing AI insights and blockchain transactions.

Tech Stack:

Framework: Next.js

UI: TailwindCSS, Recharts (for graphs)

Real-time Data: WebSockets, SWR (data fetching)

Steps:

✅ Dashboard Features:

Live AI token recommendations

Real-time blockchain transaction logs

Investment history tracking

✅ Web3 Wallet Integration:

Hive Keychain wallet for user authentication

Allow manual investment overrides

✅ Graphs & Visualizations:

Use Recharts / Chart.js to display AI trends

Example: Portfolio performance over time

✅ Optimization:

Server-side rendering (SSR) for faster load times

Lazy loading for AI insights

⛓ 4️⃣ Blockchain (Hive Smart Contracts)

Goal:

Develop Hive Smart Contracts to auto-invest based on AI insights.

Tech Stack:

Hive Blockchain SDK (Python/JavaScript)

Smart Contract Language: Clarity / Solidity (if bridging to Ethereum)

Steps:

✅ Smart Contract Logic:

Automatically invest when AI probability > 90%

Store transactions on Hive Blockchain

✅ Hive API Integration:

from beem import Hive
hive = Hive()
hive.broadcast({"operations": [...]})

✅ Security Measures:

Implement multi-signature wallets

Set investment limits to prevent AI over-investment

🚀 Next Steps

1️⃣ AI Team: Start collecting blockchain transaction data and train an LSTM model.2️⃣ Backend Team: Set up FastAPI with endpoints for AI and Hive transactions.3️⃣ Frontend Team: Build a Next.js dashboard and integrate Web3 wallet.4️⃣ Blockchain Team: Develop a Hive smart contract for auto-investing.
